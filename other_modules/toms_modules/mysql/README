include mysql::disable     # Disable mysql service.
include mysql::disableboot # Disable mysql service at boot time, but doesn't check if it's running
include mysql::absent      # Remove mysql package.

# Extended Classes (require storeconfings)
include mysql::monitor     # Monitor mysql  Automatically included if $monitor=yes
include mysql::backup      # Backup mysql data - Automatically included if $backup=yes

# Extra Classes

mysql::conf { "ParameterName": value="YourValue"} 

# Extra Defines

DEPENDENCIES:
Standard classes generally don't need external modules.
Extended classes need the relevant external modules (import monitor ; import backup ... ) and the "common" module (import common)
mysql::conf generic infile configuration define needs the "common" module
Check on individual Extra classes and defines if there are specific requirements (generally only the common module).
