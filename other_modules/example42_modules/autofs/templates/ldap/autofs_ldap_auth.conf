This files contains a single entry with multiple attributes tied to it.
The attributes are:

usetls  -  Determines whether an encrypted connection to the ldap server
	   should be attempted.  Legal values for the entry are:
	   "yes"
	   "no"

tlsrequired  -  This flag tells whether the ldap connection must be
	   encrypted.  If set to "yes", the automounter will fail to start
	   if an encrypted connection cannot be established.  Legal values
	   for this option include:
	   "yes"
	   "no"

authrequired  -  This option tells whether an authenticated connection to
	    the ldap server is required in order to perform ldap queries.
	    If this flag is set to yes, then only authenticated connections
	    will be allowed. If it is set to no then authentication is not
	    needed for ldap server connections. Finally, if it is set to
	    autodetect then the ldap server will be queried to establish
	    a suitable authentication mechanism. If no suitable mechanism
	    can be found, connections to the ldap server are made without
	    authentication.
	    Legal values for this option include:
	    "yes"
	    "no"
	    "autodetect"

authtype  -  This attribute can be used to specify a preferred
	    authentication mechanism.  In normal operations, the
	    automounter will attempt to authenticate to the ldap server
	    using the list of supportedSASLmechanisms obtained from the
	    directory server.  Explicitly setting the authtype will bypass
	    this selection and only try the mechanism specified.  Legal
	    values for this attribute include:
	    "GSSAPI"
	    "LOGIN"
	    "PLAIN"
	    "ANONYMOUS"
	    "DIGEST-MD5"

user  -  This attribute holds the authentication identity used by
	    authentication mechanisms that require it.  Legal values for
	    this attribute include any printable characters that can be
	    used by the selected authentication mechanism.

secret  -  This attribute holds the secret used by authentication
	    mechanisms that require it.  Legal values for this attribute
	    include any printable characters that can be used by the
	    selected authentication mechanism.

clientprinc  -  When using GSSAPI authentication, this attribute is
	    consulted to determine the principal name to use when
	    authenticating to the directory server.  By default, this will
	    be set to "autofsclient/<fqdn>@<REALM>.
