DESCRIPTION:
This module installs and manages autofs.
Standard and extended classes are available.
Decide and customize how you want to define configuration files: static files, templates, infile modifications...


USAGE:
# Standard Classes 
include autofs              # Install and run autofs with standard configurations.
include autofs::disable     # Disable autofs service.
include autofs::disableboot # Disable autofs service at boot time, but don't stop if it's running.
include autofs::absent      # Remove autofs package.

# Extended Classes (require storeconfings)
include autofs::monitor     # Monitor autofs  Automatically included if $monitor=yes
include autofs::backup      # Backup autofs data - Automatically included if $backup=yes
include autofs::firewall    # Manages firewall rule for autofs service - Automatically included if $firewall=yes

# Extra Classes

# Generic main configuration infile modification Define
autofs::conf { "ParameterName": value="YourValue"} 

# Extra Defines


DEPENDENCIES:
Standard classes generally don't need external modules.
Extended classes need the relevant external modules (import monitor ; import backup ... ) and the "common" module (import common)
autofs::conf generic infile configuration define needs the "common" module
Check on individual Extra classes and defines if there are specific requirements (generally only the common module).
