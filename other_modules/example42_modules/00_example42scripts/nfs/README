DESCRIPTION:
This module installs and manages nfs, client and server.
Standard and extended classes are available.


USAGE:
# Standard Classes 
include nfs::client      # Install packages and run portmap for nfs client usage
include nfs::server      # Install and run nfs daemon 
include nfs::disable     # Disable nfs service.
include nfs::disableboot # Disable nfs service at boot time, but don't stop if it's running.
include nfs::absent      # Remove nfs package.

# Extended Classes (require storeconfings)
include nfs::monitor     # Monitor nfs  Automatically included if $monitor=yes
include nfs::backup      # Backup nfs data - Automatically included if $backup=yes
include nfs::firewall    # Manages firewall rule for nfs service - Automatically included if $firewall=yes

# Extra Classes

# Generic main configuration infile modification Define
nfs::conf { "ParameterName": value="YourValue"} 

# Extra Defines


DEPENDENCIES:
Standard classes generally don't need external modules.
Extended classes need the relevant external modules (import monitor ; import backup ... ) and the "common" module (import common)
nfs::conf generic infile configuration define needs the "common" module
Check on individual Extra classes and defines if there are specific requirements (generally only the common module).
