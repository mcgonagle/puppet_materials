# Class: puppet::monitor
#
# Monitors puppet process/ports/service using Example42 monitor meta module (to be adapted to custom monitor solutions)
# It's automatically included ad used if $monitor=yes
# This class permits to abstract what you want to monitor from the actual tool and modules you'll use for monitoring
#
# Variables:
# The behaviour of this class has some defaults that can be overriden by user's variables:
# $puppet_monitor_port (true|false) : Set if you want to monitor puppet's port(s). If any. Default: As defined in $monitor_port
# $puppet_monitor_url (true|false) : Set if you want to monitor puppet's url(s). If any. Default: As defined in $monitor_url
# $puppet_monitor_process (true|false) : Set if you want to monitor puppet's process. If any. Default: As defined in $monitor_process
# $puppet_monitor_plugin (true|false) : Set if you want to monitor puppet using specific monitor tool's plugin  i   s. If any. Default: As defined in $monitor_plugin
# $puppet_monitor_target : Define how to reach (Ip, fqdn...) the host to monitor puppet from an external server. Default: As defined in $monitor_target
# $puppet_monitor_url : Define the baseurl (http://$fqdn/...) to use for eventual puppet URL checks. Default: As defined in $monitor_url
# 
# You can therefore set site wide variables that can be overriden by the above module specific ones:
# $monitor_port (true|false) : Set if you want to enable port monitoring site-wide.
# $monitor_url (true|false) : Set if you want to enable url checking site-wide.
# $monitor_process (true|false) : Set if you want to enable process monitoring site-wide.
# $monitor_plugin (true|false) : Set if you want to try to use specific plugins of your monitoring tools 
# $monitor_target : Set the ip/hostname you want to use on an external monitoring server to monitor this host
# $monitor_url : Setbaseurl to use for eventual URL checks of services provided by this host
# For the defaults of the above variables check puppet::params
#
# Usage:
# Automatically included if $monitor=yes
# Use the variable $monitor_tool (can be an array) to define the monitoring software you want to use.
# To customize specific and more granular behaviours use the above variables and eventually your custom modulename::monitor::$my_project class
