DESCRIPTION:
This module installs and manages controltier.
Standard and extended classes are available.
Decide and customize how you want to define configuration files: static files, templates, infile modifications...


USAGE:
# Standard Classes 
include controltier              # Install and run controltier with standard configurations.
include controltier::disable     # Disable controltier service.
include controltier::disableboot # Disable controltier service at boot time, but don't stop if it's running.
include controltier::absent      # Remove controltier package.

# Extended Classes (require storeconfings)
include controltier::monitor     # Monitor controltier  Automatically included if $monitor=yes
include controltier::backup      # Backup controltier data - Automatically included if $backup=yes
include controltier::firewall    # Manages firewall rule for controltier service - Automatically included if $firewall=yes

# Extra Classes

# Generic main configuration infile modification Define
controltier::conf { "ParameterName": value="YourValue"} 

# Extra Defines


DEPENDENCIES:
Standard classes generally don't need external modules.
Extended classes need the relevant external modules (import monitor ; import backup ... ) and the "common" module (import common)
controltier::conf generic infile configuration define needs the "common" module
Check on individual Extra classes and defines if there are specific requirements (generally only the common module).
